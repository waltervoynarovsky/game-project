                            BUILIDING A TRIVIA GAME

The page should greet player with message containing game's name and explaining what kind of game is it, basic rules.
It should generate 10 questions on the page and take predefined answers A-D:
-Create 20 questions and answers.
There should be a counter in top corner keeping track of player's score.
-Basic counter, maybe border and score going up to 10
When player chooses correct answer, it should indicate it with a colour and counter update.
-Get an id of what does user click and if the ID matches 'right' answer, then make the border of the questions green, add 1 to the counter, and disable asnwering same question again (although it seems difficult to do...for now)
If the answer is wrong, it also must indicate with a colour, but counter stays the same.

- If the ID of what user clicked is a 'wrong answer' then change border to red and if possible disable option to answer again.
  Upon finishing the game, it should display a message with player's score and some little comment and refresh option to start again.
